**`software developer, Database Developer`**

I'm a Python enthusiast with a passion for crafting intelligent systems and dynamic web applications. I specialize in computer vision and machine learning, building projects from the ground up that can interpret and process visual data to solve real-world problems. As a web-app developer, I handle everything from planning and design to deploying user-friendly applications. My experience also includes intermediate database management, which I use to organize and optimize data within my projects. I'm constantly exploring new ways to push the boundaries of what I can create and contribute to the tech world.
